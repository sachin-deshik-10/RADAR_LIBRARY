# Image Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the radar perception library banner image.

For the actual implementation, you would replace this with:

- A custom-designed banner image (radar_perception_banner.png)
- Dimensions: 600x200 pixels recommended
- Include radar-themed graphics and library branding
- Use modern, professional design elements

The banner should visually represent:

- Radar signal processing
- Autonomous vehicles
- Sensor fusion concepts
- Technology and innovation themes
